# Dapper.SuaveExtensions
Suave-Extensions for Dapper

Largely inspired by Dapper.SimpleCRUD (https://github.com/ericdc1/Dapper.SimpleCRUD).

I wanted to add a couple of different attributes (datestamp, soft delete), support assigned key properties and required a more testable library (removed signatures that allowed for sql where clauses to be passed).
